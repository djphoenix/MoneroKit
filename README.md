## Features
- Powerful & well-optimized mining core
- Multiple wallets/pools support - developer, vendor, end-user, etc
- Multiple backends - CPU (with multi-threading auto-scaling) and Metal (Apple GPU)
- Resource limits - leave something for regular device usage
- Want more? Welcome to Issues section!

## Installation

1. Download source (or use [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule)) into your project
2. Add MoneroKit.xcodeproj as a sub-project or into your workspace
3. Add MoneroKit.framework into "Link Binary With Libraries" section of project "Build Phases"
4. In your project/view initialization, add miner initialization code and implement "MoneroMinerDelegate" protocol (look in MoneroKitSample directory for examples)

## Mining pools

Some pools introduced limits for botnet/webmining workers. To avoid limits, you can (and should) use [xmr-node-proxy](https://github.com/Snipa22/xmr-node-proxy).

## Developer support

You may define multiple workers in your project, and define "weight" for each worker. If you want to support further development of MoneroKit, you may use following worker configuration:

```
let developerWorker = MoneroWorker(
  identifier: "donation",
  poolHost: "moneropool.phoenix.dj",
  port: 7777,
  secure: false,
  walletAddress: "",
  password: "x",
  weight: 0.1 // 10% donation
)
```

Feel free to pick any weight for donation worker, and thank you for support!
